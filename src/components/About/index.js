                    Hi, my name is Katrine. I have a B.A. in medieval literature and American history from UCONN, so you know Iâ€™m pretty good at JEOPARDY. 
                    My passions are cannabis and telling the stories of the women that have been grossly under-represented throughout history.  
                </p>
